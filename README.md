ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Kelsey!

ðŸ”Œ As a data engineer, I specialize in harnessing the power of data through SQL, machine learning, Python, and more. My journey into the world of data is informed by my diverse background.

ðŸŒ¿ With a master's degree in sustainable development, I've honed my expertise in renewable energy and materials. This unique perspective allows me to bring sustainability principles into my data engineering work.

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Additionally, I am a proud US Marine Corps veteran, having served as an electrician. During my service, I gained valuable experience planning power grids and utilizing microgrid systems for operational success.

ðŸ“Š Data engineering, sustainability, and military service - my experiences have shaped my approach to problem-solving and creativity, and I'm excited to share my projects and knowledge with the GitHub community.

Feel free to explore my repositories and let's collaborate to make the world a better place, one line of code at a time!
